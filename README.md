Authorization: Ensures users can only perform actions permitted by their roles (e.g., only owners can modify their properties).
Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse of endpoints by capping the number of requests a user can make within a time frame.

HTTPS and Encryption: All data in transit is secured via HTTPS; sensitive data like passwords is hashed or encrypted.
Why it matters:

Protects personal user data and account information.
Secures financial transactions and booking records.
Maintains trust and platform integrity by preventing abuse or unauthorized access.
